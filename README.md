# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis
## Overview
### Overview of the analysis
For our analysis, we examined the PyBer ride sharing company so that we could provide a better understanding of the various cities and areas we studied. We were able to look at Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas comparing them to the rides, drivers, and total fares for each location. We were able to create various tables, charts, and graphs in order to better present our data finding to the Pyber company to analyze and gain an edge in the ride sharing business and provide a better opportuniy for its customer service.

### Results

From our various graphs and tables that we were able to create for Pyber using Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook, we are able to further examine the key stastitics to help our recommendations to the CEO for addressing differences between the Rural, Suburban, and Urban locations. We first notice that the amount of total Drivers in Urban areas is about 5 times higher than Rural and Suburban areas combined. This is the same with total rides, where the total of Urban is is at 1625 rides and both Rural/Suburban are at 750 together. As for the Average Fare per driver and the Average Fare per ride, they follow the same order of ranking from highest to lowest. Rural is at $55.49 for driver and $34.62 for rides, while Urban is at $16.57 for driver and 24.53 for rides respectivelly. As for the Total Fares, it is ranked from Urabn to Rural highest to lowest from $39,854.38 to $4,327.93.

### Summary
If I was presenting a presentation on the analysis of my findings for recommendations on how to privde a better customer stastifcation and the growth of the ride sharing business, I would do three specific things. First thing, I would try to add more drivers in the Rural areas if possible to provide enough rides to meet the demands of the Pyber Customers. It has the highest Fare per Driver so it would provide more income for the company and moeny for the drivers, potentially increasing Rural area business as well. Next, I would try to figure out some way to raise the average Fare per Driver so that the Pyber company can profit as much as they can for the ride sharing business. the Urban area is by far there busiest location of total rides and drivers so it is the best area to gain the most profit. Lastly, from our chart, I would try to increase our rides and promotions for Pyber during the
